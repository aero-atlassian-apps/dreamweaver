# 01. Vision

## North Star

DreamWeaver exists to transform bedtime from a parenting chore into the most cherished moment of the day.

## The Dream

Every parent has felt it: the guilt of being too exhausted to read with enthusiasm, the frustration of finding age-appropriate content, the bittersweet knowledge that these tender moments are fleeting.

DreamWeaver is our answer. An AI companion that:
- **Knows your family** — learns your child's interests, remembers past conversations
- **Sounds like you** — voice cloning in 30 seconds creates stories in your voice
- **Captures magic** — automatically detects and preserves developmental milestones
- **Anticipates needs** — suggests the perfect story for a rainy Tuesday after a hard day

## Core Belief

> "Technology should strengthen human connection, not replace it."

DreamWeaver doesn't replace parents—it amplifies them. When you're exhausted, it carries your voice. When you miss bedtime (travel, late work), it keeps you present. When grandparents are far away, it brings them close.

## The Opportunity

- 40M parents in the US with children ages 3-8
- $50B/year spent on children's content
- Bedtime = daily habit = subscription-ready
- No incumbent owns this space

## What Makes Us Different

1. **True Agentic AI** — Not an LLM wrapper, but goal-directed agents
2. **Voice Clone Lock-in** — Your voice = months of stories, switching cost is emotional
3. **Memory Vault** — 50 stored memories = never-churning family
4. **Grandma Mode** — Network effects through emotional sharing
